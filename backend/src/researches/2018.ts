    abstract: "\n      This study aims to determine the antifungal activity of bitter vine (Mikania micrantha) leaf extract against Aspergillus flavus. The ethanolic method was used for extraction. One kilogram of leaves was cut into small pieces, air-dried for one week, immersed in one liter of ethanol for 48 hours with regular shaking, and filtered using filter paper. The filtrate underwent solvent extraction using a rotary evaporator to obtain an oily green extract.\n\n      Twelve plates were divided into four treatment groups: 100% bitter vine leaf extract, 50% bitter vine leaf extract, Nystatin as the positive control, and distilled water as the negative control. The study used a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three replications per treatment. Plates were assigned using lottery sampling.\n\n      Results revealed that both 100% and 50% bitter vine leaf extracts showed antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus. DMRT analysis showed that the 50% and 100% concentrations had a significant effect. The researchers concluded that bitter vine leaf extract possesses antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus.\n    ",

According to Pathak (2017), viruses, bacteria, and fungi can all cause the infection in our skin and even to our other body organs. Bacteria are living organisms that can be found everywhere; many are harmless or even good for the human body, but some can cause problems.\n    \n      According to Dhar (2018), the skin provides a remarkably good protector against bacterial infections in our body. Although many bacteria come in contact with or reside on the skin, they are normally unable to establish an infection. When bacterial skin infections do occur, they can range in size from a tiny spot to the entire body surface. They can range in seriousness as well, from harmless to life threatening. According to Cox (2016), bacterial skin infections are usually caused by gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus or other organisms. Cellulitis causes a painful, red infection that is usually warm to touch. Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles that causes red, swollen bumps that look like pimples. Impetigo causes oozing sores, usually in preschool-aged children. The bullous form of impetigo causes large blisters while the non-bullous form has a yellow, crusted appearance. Boils are firm, red, tender bumps that progress until pus accumulates underneath the skin. It is a deep skin infection that starts in hair follicles.\n    ",

There is a significant difference among the antibacterial effects of the different concentrations of Sinaw sinaw (Peperomia pellucida) Leaf Extract on Staphyloccocus aureus in terms of zone of inhibition (in millimeters) twenty-four hours after the incubation. The results showed that the most effective treatment is the 100% pure Sinaw sinaw Peperomia pellucida) leaf extract. The researchers recommend using the Sinaw sinaw plant as an antibacterial against the diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus and they also recommend testing its anticancer and antifungal effect for further studies.\n    ",

Preliminary study was first conducted to determine the median lethal concentration of Crescentia cujete leaf extract using Brine Shrimp Lethality Test. The test was the basis for the formulation of treatments to be used.\n    \n      Five treatments were prepared: 100ug/mL, 200pg/mL and 300ug/mL of Crescentia cujete leaf extract, 0.025mg/mL Methrotreate as the positive control and distilled water as the negative control to which the experimental treatments are to be compared. The mean vascular density for each replication was computed from the counted number of blood vessel branch points produced in each field of view 48 hours after application. Results revealed that Crescentia cujete leaf extract was significantly lower when each experimental treatment was compared to the negative control and not significantly different to the positive control showing the same anti-angiogenic effect. Thus, it was concluded that Crescentia cujete leaf extract exhibits anti-angiogenic activity.\n    ",

Hence, many people search to discover different ways to stop this dengue and malaria causing mosquitoes from reproducing and multiplying. One of the ways to prevent this is through the use of larvicides. Yet, some larvicides are hazardous not only to mosquitoes but also to human being and the environment. The objective of this research is to create a larvicide that would not affect the environment and humans.\n    \n      Dioscorea hispida was chosen because of its availability and the phytochemicals present in the plant that can be used to exterminate mosquitoes. The study was conducted to find out the larvicidal activity of Kayos (Dioscorea hispida) leaf extract as a larvicide against mosquito (Culicidae) wrigglers. Kayos (Dioscorea hispida) leaves were extracted and set into treatments: 1000 ppm, 100 ppm, 10 ppm and 0 ppm (negative).\n    \n      The larvicidal activity of the different treatments were determined using WHO standard in testing of larvicide with little modifications. The mortality rate of mosquito wrigglers and LC50 were determined after 48 hours of applications. Results displayed that 1000 ppm of extract significantly affected the mortality rate of the larvae and the ethanolic extract of Dioscorea hispida leaves has an LC50 of 1055.513 ppm 48 hours after application of treatments. The researchers conclude that the ethanolic extract of Kayos (Dioscorea hispida) leaves has a larvicidal activity against mosquito wrigglers and thus, the plant leaf extract can be applied and used as an agent for vector control.\n    ",
