    abstract:`
      Humans cut down 80,000 to 160,000 trees around the world every day, and use many of them to make paper. (Beverly Law, 2021) . Rice husk is an abundantly available waste material in all rice producing countries, and it contains about 30%-50% of organic carbon. (Singh, 2018) This research aims to evaluate the potential of rice husk as a packaging material.The rice husk, cornstarch and glue were gathered and set into different proportions. Set-up A (60% Rice husk, 0% Cornstarch, 40% Glue), Set-up B (40% Rice Husk, 20% Cornstarch, 40% Glue) and Set-up C (20% Rice Husk, 40% Cornstarch, 40% Glue). Eco-Safe Handmade Paper Production from Rice Straws with minor revisions was the method used in making the papers. The quality of paper produced from different proportions of rice husk, corn starch and glue was determined one day after the papers have fully dried.
    
      Ten respondents were asked to give off ratings to assess the color and texture of the produced paper. Tensile strength of paper is then measured. DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS was used to determine the difference in terms of color and texture of the produced paper from rice husk to that of commercial paper. ANOVA was used to determine if there is a significant difference in the tensile strength of the produced paper and the commercial paper. In terms of color and texture of the paper, Treatment C is more favored of the respondents. Tensile strength reveals that Treatment C is significantly higher than that of Treatment D (positive control). Researchers recommends the use of rice husk as a base material for paper packaging production.

    abstract: `
      Household wastewater is produced by domestic activities which is a serious environmental challenge due to its potential negative effects on water resources, ecosystems, and human health. In order to reduce these dangers and advance sustainable development, household wastewater treatment is extremely important. Coagulation-flocculation followed by clarifying is the typical treatment for wastewater.
    
      The study was conducted to determine the flocculating ability of Alusiman (Portulaca oleracea) leaf extract in terms of turbidity, pH level, and microbiological parameters in treating household wastewater after 24 hours of application of treatment Potassium Aluminum Sulfate, known as tawas, was selected as the coagulant while the leaf was extracted using decoction method. The samples were sent to Central Philippine University laboratory for analysis.
    
      The results showed that in terms of turbidity, the tawas (Potassium alum sulfate) with alusiman (Potulaca oleracea) has an effect on the turbidity of household wastewater because it elevated the NTU of the household wastewater. In terms of pH level, the tawas (Potassium alum sulfate) with alusiman (Portulaca oleracea) has an effect on the pH level of the household wastewater because it lowered the pH level of the household wastewater. And in terms of microbiological parameters, the tawas (Potassium aluminum sulfate) with alusiman (Potulaca oleracea) has no effect which imposes that tawas with alusiman is not effective in terms of microbiological parameters.
    
      It was demonstrated that the results of turbidity and pH level did not pass the standard set by World Health Organization (WHO) - Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (GDWQ) and Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water (PNSDW) while it failed the microbiological parameters set by the standard. Results concluded that alusiman (Portulaca oleracea) is not an effective flocculant.

    abstract:`
      Fruit fly is a small fly that can be found near rotten fruits. They carry bacteria like salmonella, E. Listeria and E. coli which can cause food poisoning. These insects directly harm fruits and vegetables by puncturing them to lay and develop their larvae. Therefore, this study aims to determine the insecticidal effect of Ageratum conyzoides against Drosophila melanogaster. Experimental method was employed using Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with treatments assigned via lottery method. One hundred-fifty Drosophila melanogaster were baited at and were cultured. Meanwhile, three kilograms of Ageratum conyzoides were air dried for one month and were powderized using an electric blender. The powdered leaves were immersed in methanol for 24 hours and were shaken and filtered using Whatman filter paper no. 1. The filtrate has undergone rotary evaporation. Fifteen beakers containing ten adult Drosophila melanogaster with standard food were prepared and sprayed with five treatments mainly: 50, 25 and 10 mg/mL of Ageratum conyzoides leaf extract, distilled water as negative control and Baygon Multi-insect Killer as positive control and it was replicated three times. The number of dead Drosophila melanogaster was recorded after one hour application of treatments. Results showed that among the different concentrations, only treatment with 50 mg/mL of Ageratum conyzoides leaf extract has an insecticidal effect on Drosophila melanogaster one hour after application. However, there is a significant difference in the insecticidal effect among the different concentrations of Ageratum conyzoides leaf extract, as compared to Baygon Multi-Insect Killer (positive control) with the highest insecticidal effect on the percent mortality of Drosophila melanogaster one hour after application of treatments.

      Fever, characterized by an elevated body temperature, is a common symptom associated with various physiological and pathological conditions. Natural remedies derived from medicinal plants have been explored as potential sources for antipyretic agents. This study aimed to determine the antipyretic activity of Pansit-pansitan (Peperomia pellucida) and Fringed Spiderflower (Cleome rutidosperma) leaf extracts on white mice (Mus musculus). The Pansit-pansit and Fringed Spiderflower were extracted using the hand-squeezing and blending method. The white mice were purchased in a pet store; all aged between 8-12 weeks old. The treatments that were used are 100 % concentration of Pansit-pansit (Treatment A), Fringed Spiderflower (Treatment B), and Negative control (Treatment C). Fever were induced in all mice by subcutaneous injection of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisie) extract powder suspension. Only mice with a temperature increase of at least 0.5° C after yeast injection. The data were collected through observation of the changes in temperature of pyrexia-induced white mice after 3 hours for each treatment. The results revealed that the antipyretic activity of Fringed Spiderflower (Treatment B) had the highest mean decrease followed by Pansit-pansit (Treatment A). However, both treatments were not significantly different to the Negative control (Treatment C). The researchers recommend that further studies be conducted in order to test the antipyretic activity of both Pansit-pansitan (Peperomia pellucida) and Fringed Spiderflower (Cleome rutidosperma).

      Oil spills pose hazard to the aquatic and land communities. It is essential to solve this environmental problem by developing a solution such as sorbent pillow. This study aims to determine the oil sorption capacity of Mahogany Sawdust, Peanut Shells and Bamboo Fiber Wastes as natural sorbents for oil spill.
    
      The Mahogany Sawdust, Peanut Shells, and Bamboo Fiber Wastes were gathered, washed, dried, and processed, and were contained in an improvised 9 cm x 12 cm pillow using aluminum mesh with 0.35 mm holes. The pillows initial weight (Si) was weighed before they were deployed into fifteen plastic basins, each filled with one liter of artificial seawater and 80 milliliters of crude oil. The pillows were left in the system for one hour, then were retrieved and drained for 5 minutes. Finally, the remaining oil from the basins was measured.
    
      To determine the oil sorption capacity of the sorbents, the initial and final amounts of oil were compared, along with the weight of the sorbent material. For the data analysis, the researchers utilized statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and ANOVA.
    
      The oil sorption capacities of Mahogany Sawdust, Peanut Shells, Bamboo Fiber Wastes, and Aluminum Mesh (-) were evaluated and recorded. Results revealed that while Bamboo Fiber Wastes appeared to have the highest mean oil sorption capacity, the ANOVA results indicate no significant difference between the materials in terms of their oil sorption capacities. Thus, the study suggests that the performances of the materials were comparable with each other.

      In Philippines, the native chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) breeds have a vast population. However, despite its popularity diseases, climate change, pests, and lack of capital to buy high cost feeds are some factors that affect the quality of poultry products (Dusaran & Pabulayan, 2015). This study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion on growth performance in native chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus).
    
      The Acapulco leaves (Senna alata) were gathered and dried via oven-drying. The acapulco leaves (Senna alata) were powdered mixed to ground corn. The native chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were feed twice a day (7:00am and 4:00pm) and 10 grams each. A total of 30 native chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were randomly assigned into two diets: Treatment A (control) and Treatment B (experimental). The feeding trial duration was four weeks. Mean and t test were used to analyze the data.
    
      Results revealed that the feed conversion efficiency of Treatment B is significantly higher that Treatment A. Chickens fed with Treatment B showed significant effect on growth. However, Treatment A had significantly higher growth performances in terms of voluntary feed intake and weight gain. The dietary inclusion of Acapulco leaves (Senna alata) showed positive effects on the growth performance of native chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) but less effective than commercial feed.

      The Automatic Water Level Sensor is a promising technological innovation designed to address water scarcity issues in aquaculture and fishpond operations. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of the automatic water level sensor specifically for fishpond owners in the Philippines, where aquaculture plays a significant role in the economy.
    
      By accurately detecting water levels and activating the water supply system only when necessary, this sensor offers a cost-effective and sustainable solution to optimize fish growth and minimize water wastage. The research involved conducting 50 trials to assess the sensor's performance, with 44 successful outcomes and 6 instances of failure. The reliability of the sensor was determined to be 91.7%, indicating its high reliability in accurately measuring water levels in fishponds.
    
      However, further improvements are recommended to enhance the sensor's performance, durability, and maintenance requirements specifically for aquaculture settings. The study highlights the potential benefits of using the automatic water level sensor for fishpond owners, aqua culturists, and future researchers. Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of expanding the study area to include more fishponds, conducting long-term monitoring of sensor performance, comparing with other water management methods, performing cost-benefit analysis for fishpond operations, and assessing environmental impacts related to water usage and conservation in aquaculture settings.

      This study aimed to determine the antiproliferative potential of the methanolic extract of Corchorus olitorius leaf extract on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The plant samples were extracted methanolically, air-dried until it could be blended for powderization, soaked in methanol for 24 hours, filtered with filter paper, and the filtrate kept. Each experimental group had three replicates that were put in each test tube. The antiproliferative level was determined using percentage of cell viability 24 hours after application of treatments using mean and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results revealed that Treatment 3 (1000 ug/ml) has the lowest cell viability with X= 33.33 and s= 1.60. Thus, it was concluded that Treatment 3 has the highest antiproliferative activity on Saccharomyces cerevisiae as cell viability is inversely proportional to antiproliferative activity. Furthermore, it was revealed that Treatment 3 is highly significant than the other treatments. Hence, it was recommended that Corchorus olitorius leaf extract should be used as an alternative antiproliferative treatment to abnormal cell growth. The Corchorus olitorius leaf extract should be used as a part of pharmaceutical compounds and as natural herbal medicine. However, further studies exploring Corchorus olitorius leaf extract mechanism of action as an antiproliferative and possible toxicological properties.

      Tailor's chalk is used for marking fabric in tailoring and dressmaking (Blair & Gaulton, 2008). In other way, when fabric and garments are handled, some of these tailors' chalk markings can be accidentally brushed off, making them less visible and difficult for dressmakers to undo markings. This study aims to determine the acceptability of tahong (Perna viridis) shells and achiote (Bixa orellana) seed extract as tailor's chalk. The Perna viridis shells were collected and pulverized. Wax extraction was used to extract the pigment from Bixa orellana seeds. The tailor's chalks were made by mixing different amounts of Perna viridis pulverized shell (10 g, 15 g, and 20 g,) with 30 g of Bixa orellana seed extract. It was then put into a mold and placed under the sun for 48 hours. A survey was conducted among students of the tailoring department to rate the acceptability of each tailor's chalk in terms of its texture and ease of marking. Results revealed that tahong shells and achiote seed extract as tailor's chalk is acceptable in terms of its texture and ease of marking, as verified by the statistical tool Mean. ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference among the treatments. Furthermore, tailor's chalk made of 20 g of tahong shells and 30 g of achiote seed extract is the most acceptable among experimental treatments as tailor's chalk, and it contains a high amount of calcium carbonate which is effective in making tailor's chalk.

      The domestic chicken industry provides huge support to its consumers (Native Chicken Industry Profile, 2023). A significant issue is the emergence of nematode and trematode resistance to different classes of anthelmintics (Vercruysse & Claerebout, 2022). Anthelmintic is a drug used against helminth infections (Britannica, 2017). It is the term used in treating infections of parasitic worms on humans and livestock (Holden-Dye & Walker, 2016).

      This study was conducted to determine the anthelmintic activity of powdered tamarind (Tamarindus indica) seeds and oregano (Origanum vulgare) leaves on native chicken. In this study, the tamarind seeds and oregano leaves were gathered, prepared then air-dried in Barangay Inaladan, Cabatuan, Iloilo, and oven dried at Cabatuan National Comprehensive High School, and both were placed in an electric blender to powderize. The powders were mixed and formulated into different concentrations and placed in a capsule based on the body weight of the chickens.
    
      The results showed that in the mean for three days, Treatment 1 has the highest number of parasitic worms excreted with a mean of 12.22 followed by Treatment 4 with 3.66, and Treatments 2 and 3 with 3.44 respectively.

      Using ANOVA, it showed that there is no significant difference since the p-value (0.203) is greater than the alpha level (0.05). Results have shown that there is no significant difference in the treatments therefore, the results are comparable. Both tamarind seeds and oregano leaves possessed anthelmintic activity.
    
      The researchers recommend that tamarind and oregano can be used as a component for anthelmintic medicine and other pharmaceutical purposes. However, further studies about the other parts of both tamarind and oregano and a larger sample size for the native chicken are recommended.

    abstract:`
      The Philippines is a predominantly an agricultural country, with most of its land dedicated to farming. However, the top subsectors of agriculture generate significant amount of waste. Thus waste is often scattered, contributing to the country's pollution and solid waste problem. Nevertheless, biogas produced form farm waste through anaerobic digestion is a promising alternative to nonrenewable sources of energy, especially as a fuel for heating. However, more research is needed to determine the amount of heat  produced by biogas generated from farm waste. Thus, thus study aims  to determine the value of heat produced by biogas generated from farm waste via anaerobic digestion. In this study, two treatments with two trials each were formulated using pig dung and cow dung, respectively,  and mixed with mineral water in a 2:1 ratio. Calorimetry was used to determine the amount of heat produced by each treatment. The results showed that the two trials of pig dung generated a mean value of 7252.125413 calories of heat, while two trials of cow dung, produced a mean value of 5108.9068815 calories of heat. The data was analyzed using t test. Results revealed that there is no significant difference in the amount of heat produced by pig dung compared to cow dung. The biogas generated from a small quantity of pig and cow dung within a short duration of time has a comparable heating value to dry firewood. Thus, it is advisable to use biogas from pig and cow dung as a fuel source of heating.

    Since people use traditional medicines as alternative cures to treat various infections and illnesses, chemically produced medication from bamboo shoots is not common in the pharmaceutical industry. This study aims to determine the antibacterial effect of bamboo shoot (Bambusa blumeana) extract against staph (Staphylococcus aureus). Bamboo shoots have antibacterial properties that revealed the presence of flavonoids, phytosterols, tannins, resins, and phenols. The study was conducted at Central Philippine University, College of Agriculture, Resources, and Environmental Sciences at Jaro, Iloilo City on May 6-9, 2023.
    
    There are six treatments, which contain different concentrations (100%, 75%, 50%, 25% of the extract and the positive and negative control. The bamboo shoots were oven dried and pulverized, then, its powdered plant material was soaked in 95% food-grade ethanol for 20 hours and left in an ultralow freeze drier for 20 hours. Then, the solvent extraction was squeezed using cheesecloth. It was then filtered to remove the solid materials.
    
    Lastly, it underwent a rotary evaporator. All of the treatments, except for the negative control formed a zone of inhibition, that possesses antibacterial effect on Staphylococcus aureus. In order to measure its efficacy, the researchers utilized statistical tools using Mean, Standard Deviation, One-Way ANOVA, and Duncan's Multiple Range Test. It was found out that the 75% of bamboo shoot (Bambusa blumeana) extract has the highest zone of inhibition. The researchers recommended the other parts of the bamboo shoot specifically, its skin that is often discarded as waste by others. Bamboo shoots Bambusa blumeana should also be considered as a natural herbal medicine and could further enhance its antibacterial effects against other bacteria.

      Fires can consume anything in its path if not prevented. This study was conducted to find out whether the Magallana bilineata and Acetic Acid Fire Retardant Spray as Fire Asphyxiator was effective in putting off Class A fire.The study was conducted at the Cabatuan National Comprehensive High School. 
    
      The researchers used a portable pressure sprayer as the fire extinguisher container. The Fire Retardant Spray was made by putting 16.68 grams of powdered Oyster Shells wrapped in tissue and a net held on top of the container by a thread. Four hundred milliliters of Vinegar was put into the lower part of the container. A pressure gauge was placed on the container to measure the pressure. Twenty psi of pressure was pumped into the sprayer before shaking the solution, therefore, reaching the desired pressure of forty psi before spraying the solution at the base of the fire. The product was applied to Class A fire which was made by combusting kerosene into the wood. The time was recorded in seconds as the Fire Retardant Spray and commercial Fire Extinguisher put off the fire. T- test for two independent samples revealed that the used of the Fire Retardant Spray and commercial Fire Extinguisher have no significant difference in putting off Class A fires.
    
      The researchers concluded that the Fire Retardant Spray has a significant effect in putting off Class A Fire. The researchers recommend using the Fire Retardant Spray as an alternative fire extinguisher.
