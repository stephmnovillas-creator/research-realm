      Aquaculture is essential to reducing poverty and ensuring food security globally. Fish meal has historically been the main source of protein for the aquafeed business, but fluctuations in price and unstable supply have forced a partial or total switch to more sustainable raw materials. The Urtica dioica leaf powder has a higher crude protein (33.8%), crude fiber (9.1%), crude fat (3.6%), and carbs (37.4%) composition than other leaf powders, with an energy value of 307 kcal/ 100g. The purpose of this study was to test if Urtica dioica leaves can be used as an alternative feed protein source for African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). The Urtica dioica leaves were gathered from Brgy. Ayong, Cabatuan, Iloilo. 90 Clarias gariepinus were acquired from Dumangas, Iloilo. There were three treatments in this study: Treatment A (100% fish meal), Treatment B (75% fish meal + 25% Urtica dioica leaves), and Treatment C (50% fish meal + 50% Urtica dioica leaves). Randomized Complete Body Design (RCBD) was used as the experimental design. Urtica dioica leaves was oven-dried, combined with other components and pelletized. The catfish were fed twice daily. After one week, the catfish were weighed. The feed conversion ratio was calculated by dividing average feed consumption over their average weight gain. The researchers used SPSS for statistical analysis, including mean and ANOVA. Results showed that Urtica dioica leaves have a significant effect on the average weight gain of Clarias gariepinus juveniles after one week of feeding.

      Widespread natural disasters are a major issue in the Philippine industry, causing a decline in production and quality of essential natural fibers like abaca and piña, leading to increased production costs and compromised quality (ABACA n.d). This study aims to assess the potential of sugarcane and lemongrass as source of plant fibers, focusing on their tensile strength and differentiating their potential. The Saccharum officinarum (Sugarcane) and Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) fibers were extracted using the Combing Extraction method from the study of Mahmud and Anannya (2021) and Bekele et al. (2017). The plants were cleaned using clean water. Different materials like scrapper, crusher, dissolving water, and dry towel were also utilized in this study. To ensure the quality of the fiber the Sugarcane were boiled with Caustic Soda, while the Lemongrass were immersed in Calcium Hydroxide. Then, the average diameter of the fibers were measured. Saccharum officianarum (Sugarcane) and Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) fibers were evaluated for their tensile strength wherein three replications were made. For Data analysis, this study utilized statistical tools such as the Mean, Standard Deviation and ANOVA. Results showed that Saccharum officinarum (Sugarcane) and Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) fibers are classified as Low Tensile Strength based on the study of TEVEMA (2023). It also showed that there is no significant difference between the tensile strength of Saccharum officinarum (Sugarcane) and Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) as Source of Plant fibers. The researchers recommend exploring new methods in fiber extraction, aiming to find better solutions that benefit both industries and nature.

      Gastric acidity-related conditions, such as acid reflux and hyperacidity, are commonly managed using synthetic antacids, which may cause adverse side effects. This study aimed to evaluate the antacid potential of Muntingia calabura (sarisa) leaf extract as a natural alternative. The extract, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, was analyzed using a pH meter to determine its acid-neutralizing effect when mixed with hydrochloric acid (HCl). The results were compared to distilled water (negative control) and sodium bicarbonate (positive control). Results showed that the extract had a mean pH level of 1.5, which is below the 3.5 threshold suggested by Lirazan, Cua, and Alvarez (2018) and Dhawal & Barve (2020), indicating that it does not meet the criteria to be classified as an antacid. Statistical analysis using One-Way ANOVA revealed significant differences in pH levels among the treatments. Post-hoc analysis confirmed a significant difference between sodium bicarbonate and both Muntingia calabura leaf extract and distilled water, but no significant difference between the extract and distilled water, further supporting its lack of antacid activity. Based on these results, the extract is not recommended as an antacid. However, further research on different extraction methods, higher concentrations, and phytochemical isolation may provide deeper insights into its potential therapeutic applications.

    abstract:`
      The world is facing an energy crisis due to the growing demand for non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels. However, these energy sources are rapidly depleting and contribute significantly to environmental pollution. Silicon-based solar cells offer a potential solution to the depletion of non-renewable energy sources, but they come with a high upfront cost and are complicated to produce. Thus, the health hazards associated with synthetic dye sensitizers have prompted research into natural dye substitutes. This study aimed to determine the bio-photovoltaic potential of Peperomia pellucida leaf extract as a dye sensitizer. Peperomia pellucida leaves were methanolically extracted and the bio-photovoltaic potential of its extract was determined based on the procedure of Mohammed, Ahmad & Azeez (2015) and Amin, Ridwan & Aziz (2022) with Rhodamine B as positive control and methanol as a negative control. The voltage produced as per treatment was statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's HSD. The result revealed that the voltage output of the experimental treatment (Peperomia pellucida leaf extract) is significantly higher than that of the negative control (methanol) but is not significantly different from that of the positive control (Rhodamine B). Thus, it was concluded that Peperomia pellucida has bio-photovoltaic potential as a dye sensitizer and is recommended to be further studied as the dye sensitizer in fabricating organic solar cells.

      Histological staining is essential for the visualization of microscopic structures in biological specimens. However, the use of synthetic dyes, such as eosin, raises environmental and health concerns due to their toxic and carcinogenic properties. This study explored the potential of Red Dragon Fruit (Selenicereus undatus) peelings and Red Onion (Allium cepa) skin as natural specimen stains, offering an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative. The pigments were extracted using ethanol-based maceration, and their staining efficacy was evaluated through absorbance analysis using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was employed to test different ethanol concentrations (40%, 70%, and 95%), with commercial eosin serving as the control. Results showed that the 95% ethanol extract exhibited the highest absorbance among the plant-based stains, demonstrating significant staining potential. However, statistical analysis revealed that while the natural extracts provided adequate staining, they did not achieve the same intensity as eosin. Despite this, the findings support the viability of natural stains as a safer and more sustainable alternative. Future research should focus on optimizing extraction methods and assessing the long-term stability of these natural dyes for histological applications.

      The supply of nonrenewable fuels is decreasing, and pollution is inflicting significant harm to the environment and the health of living organisms. There is a major demand for more environmentally friendly and renewable fuels (Soni et al., 2016). The leaf extract from Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) was used as a dye-sensitizer in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) which uses sunlight as a source of energy. This study was conducted to determine the bio-photovoltaic potential of Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) leaf extract as a dye-sensitized solar cell in terms of voltage output (in millivolts) after every one hour for the duration of three hours. The leaf of Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) was washed and pulverized using a grinder; the resulting powder was submerged in methanol and macerated for 24 hours and then filtered. The filtrate was then sent to a research institution to undergo rotary evaporation. In the fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), 10 milliliters of Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) extract was used as dye-sensitizer, as well as Rhodamine B (positive control), and distilled water (negative control). There were three replications of each of the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells. ANOVA indicates that there is no significant difference in the bio-photovoltaic potential, specifically in the voltage output (in mV), among the treatments: Syzygium cumini (Java Plum) leaf extract (experimental), Rhodamine B (positive control), and distilled water (negative control). Thus, it was concluded that it is not advised to use Syzygium cumini as an alternative dye-sensitized solar cell.

      The increasing antimicrobial resistance has led to the search for plant-based alternatives. This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of Semecarpus cuneiformis (Anagas) leaf extract against Staphylococcus aureus using the Agar Well Diffusion Assay. Three extract concentrations (0.75 mg/ml, 0.50 mg/ml, 0.25 mg/ml) were tested, alongside Cefazolin (positive control) and distilled water (negative control). All extract concentrations inhibited S. aureus, with 0.50 mg/ml showing the highest activity (17.42 mm mean inhibition zone). However, Cefazolin (67.33 mm) was significantly more effective. ANOVA analysis indicated a significant difference among treatments (p < 0.05), rejecting the null hypothesis. These findings suggest that Semecarpus cuneiformis leaf extract has antimicrobial potential but is less effective than commercial antibiotics. Further research should explore higher concentrations, optimize formulations, and assess its viability as an alternative antimicrobial agent.

    abstract:`
      This study investigated the anticoagulant properties of Excoecaria cochinchinensis leaf extract on human blood. Excessive coagulation can lead to severe conditions such as thrombosis and stroke, highlighting the need for effective anticoagulant therapies (Streiff, 2023). However, synthetic anticoagulants like warfarin and heparin pose challenges due to adverse effects and high costs (Kiflemariam et al., 2022). Medicinal plants, including Excoecaria cochinchinensis, are being explored as potential alternatives due to their bioactive compounds, particularly flavonoids, which have demonstrated anticoagulant effects by inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation (Mark S. et al., 2021). This study employs an experimental design to evaluate the effect of varying concentrations of Excoecaria cochinchinensis leaf extract on blood clotting time using Lee White Method. Clotting time was measured using standard coagulation assays, and statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests revealed significant differences between treatment groups (p < 0.05). Results indicate that the extract effectively prolongs clotting time, suggesting the presence of natural anticoagulant compounds. These findings support the potential of Excoecaria cochinchinensis as a plant-based anticoagulant, offering a promising alternative to synthetic drugs. Further research is recommended to isolate and characterize the active compounds, determine their precise mechanisms of action, and evaluate their clinical safety and efficacy. This study contributes to the growing body of research on natural anticoagulants and their applications in medical and pharmaceutical fields, potentially offering safer and more accessible alternatives for managing coagulation disorders.

    abstract:`
      Soil-based agriculture is the oldest form of crop production. Crops heavily depend on the soil for support, water, and nutrients. However, conventional agriculture's detrimental effects specifically affect natural ecosystems, as seen by high and inefficient water demand, vast acreage needs, fertilizer use, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss. These various farming issues are addressed by aquaponics. Based on Baganz et al. (2018), the term aquaponics, which combines aquaculture and hydroponics, describes a technology that incorporates the two methods into a single system in which the nutrient-rich water from aquaculture is utilized as fertilizer for the plants that are grown. Banana pseudostems present a novel and sustainable alternative to conventional growth media in aquaponics.
      
      Qualities of banana pseudostems make them suitable as a growth medium for plants; consequently, further research needs to be employed. The purpose of this study is to determine the growth performance of Brassica oleracea var. capitata (Cabbage) in an aquaponic system using banana pseudostem as growth medium.

      There were two treatments in this study: Treatment A (Aquaponic system), Treatment B (Conventional soil-based system). Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used as the experimental design. After 14 days, the plants were measured on three key parameters: height (in cm), number of leaves, and leaf length (in cm).

      The researchers used SPSS as a statistical tool for Independent Samples T-test and mean. Results show that there is no significant difference between the two treatments for all parameters except the number of leaves, with a p-value of 0.018.

      Leptocorisa acuta, a major pest in Philippine rice production, causes significant yield reductions by feeding on developing grains and transmitting sheath rot disease. The heavy reliance on chemical pesticides highlights the need for alternative, sustainable pest management strategies. This study investigates the insecticidal activity of Alocasia macrorrhizos leaf extract on Leptocorisa acuta.

      A total of 120 insects were captured, and the extract was obtained using methanol as a solvent and rotary evaporation. Four concentrations were tested: 100 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, and distilled water (negative control). Statistical analysis revealed that the extract exhibited high insecticidal activity. The 100 mg/ml concentration resulted in the highest mortality rate, significantly higher than the 20 mg/ml concentration, but does not significantly differ from the 50 mg/ml concentration. The 50 mg/ml concentration significantly differs from the 20 mg/ml concentration. Additionally, there is a significant difference observed between the 100 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml, and 20 mg/ml concentrations compared to the negative control. These findings indicate that Alocasia macrorrhizos has promising potential as a natural insecticide. However, further toxicity testing and field trials are needed to confirm its safety and efficacy for use in pest management in agriculture.

      Wood is a widely used material in construction and furniture production due to its availability. However, its susceptibility to environmental factors, including moisture absorption and termite damage, presents a major challenge (Salca et al., 2016; Ney et al., 2019). Traditional chemical wood preservatives, though effective in keeping the wood from deteriorating, raise environmental and health concerns, prompting the search for sustainable alternatives (Hasanagic et al., 2023). Thus, this study aimed to determine the potential of Cassia fistula seed oil as a wood preservative in terms of tangential swelling, water absorption, and termite repellency of Cocos nucifera lumber. The oil was extracted from the seeds using a rotary evaporator and compared to a commercial wood preservative using a randomized experimental setup with three repetitions. Tests for swelling and water absorption were done at intervals of 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while termite repellency was measured using a choice assay. Results showed that Cassia fistula seed oil significantly reduced swelling compared to the commercial preservative, helping the wood keep its shape better when exposed to water. Although there was no significant difference between the seed oil and the commercial preservative in terms of water absorption and termite repellency, the seed oil showed a higher repellency rate (90%) than the commercial option (76.67%). These results suggest that Cassia fistula seed oil could be an effective and eco-friendly wood preservative. Further research is recommended to improve its use and study its long-term effects.

      Pineapple (Ananas comosus) leaves contain strong natural fibers with potential industrial applications. However, the quality of these fibers may be influenced by environmental factors, including soil properties and cultivation methods. Thus, this study aimed to compare the fiber characteristics of Ananas comosus leaves from two different locations, Brgy. Salunga, Cabatuan, and Brgy. Bita-ogan, Passi City, by analyzing their tensile strength and soil quality. Pineapple leaves were collected from both locations, processed through retting in a 6% Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution, and tested for fiber strength. Soil samples were also analyzed for pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) content. A Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) was employed, with three replications per location. Data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, t-test, Shapiro-Wilk test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient.

      Results indicated no significant difference in fiber tensile strength between the two locations, suggesting that wild-grown Ananas comosus from Cabatuan and farm-cultivated Ananas comosus from Passi City produce fibers of comparable quality. Soil analysis also showed no significant difference in nutrient composition. These findings suggest that pineapple leaf fibers, regardless of their growing environment, possess consistent quality, reinforcing their viability as a sustainable material for industrial use.

    abstract:`
      The production of solid fuels, including wood charcoal, is often associated with environmental impacts, particularly as consumption gradually increases. One of the most widely cited consequences of wood charcoal production is deforestation (Chidumayo et al., 2012). Various studies have been conducted to address these issues by producing sustainable solid fuel briquettes from agricultural waste. However, gaps remain, particularly regarding the heat output and burn time of these solid fuels when ignited. According to Bioresource Technology Reports (2021), solid fuel briquettes are compressed blocks of coal dust or other flammable biomass. The characteristics of coconut (Cocos nucifera) spadix make it a suitable candidate for use in solid fuel briquettes. This study aimed to evaluate the heat output and burn duration of coconut spadix as a potential solid fuel briquette. The experiment involved two treatments: Treatment 1 (coconut spadix as a solid fuel) and Treatment 2 (commercial solid fuel). A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used for the experimental setup. After 12 days of preparation, the coconut spadix briquettes were tested for heat transfer and burn duration, comparing them to commercial solid fuel. Temperature (°C), weight (g), and burn time (minutes) were measured. Microsoft Excel's Analysis ToolPak was used to calculate means and perform a t-test. The results indicated a significant difference between the two treatments, suggesting comparable performance.

      The Garcinia binucao bio-battery produced an average voltage output of 1.085 V, an average current production of 6.02 mA, and an average power generation of 6.51 mW. Results revealed a significant difference in performance, with the commercial battery exhibiting higher efficiency. While the bio-battery generated electricity, its output was lower than that of the commercial counterpart. The findings highlight the need for further optimization to enhance the efficiency of bio-batteries as a sustainable energy source.
